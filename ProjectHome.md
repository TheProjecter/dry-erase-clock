## What is it? ##

> This project was to create a clock that could hold a marker and write the current time every minute. the video below describes the pieces of the project and describes the setup. the project was very cheap, only using three servos, some wood and an arduino.

## Limitations ##

> Some of the limitations with the way that the project is currently set up are the size of the numbers, only being able to display 12 hour time, and the sometimes messy writing of the numbers. The small size is due to the small length of the arms. I decided to use small legos for the arms in an attempt to get the numbers looking as neat as possible. Since I did not add any switches or buttons to the project there is no way to change between 12 and 24 hour time. This would be a simple addition with the way the code is written and could be implemented in the future. Finally the messy numbers was the most disappointing part of the project for me. Since I used legos of the arms, they have a bit of an unsteady connection at the joints, causing some of the randomness when the arms move. Also the code could have been optimized more, this is discussed in more detail in the code section of the wiki.

## Changes and Improvements ##

> One of the major improvements I hope to have working in the future is adding an eraser to the system. I already have written the code to grab and eraser and go over the numbers to erase, but when testing the current setup can not push hard enough to erase the numbers. This is the one thing that would make the system work continually, and would be the biggest improvement to the project. The only change I would make to what is already built would be to find a way to make the numbers larger and more consistently written. The size and sloppiness of the letters and the lack of erasing are the only issues with the current state of the project.
