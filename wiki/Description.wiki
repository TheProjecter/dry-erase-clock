== Circuit ==

The circuit used is an extremely simple one. The only components are the arduino and three servos. The three servos are connected to the VCC pin and GND pin on the arduino and also to pins 3,4,5 respectively for the data. This is the only circuit need for the project.

== Alternative Approaches ==

The main difference in the way I designed this clock and other ways of doing it are the way the numbers are written. I decided to do a point by point approach for each number. I broke each cell down into 14 points and connected the correspond points for each number to try to give the look of a seven segment display. Other people who have done similar projects have not broken the cell into points, but had the servos move a different speeds for different amounts of time to write each letter. This approach is much more complicated but could result in smoother numbers.

== Problems and Solutions ==

The main issue as mention before is the lack of erasing of the system. this is the final thing needed to make this a function clock. Below is a demonstration of how the erasing works, if the servo was able to push hard enough to erase the numbers

The solution to this problem would be to either replace the servo or the arms of the system to be able to apply more pressure to the board. And also a small compartment would need to be built to hold the eraser between the erasing functions. With these additions the system would be able to run by itself.

== Next Step ==

The next step would be trying to find a way to mount the system on a wall, and to maybe increase the size of the numbers. This would make the project actually usable in the real world, and would be a cool clock for an engineering firm or department to try to bring in more people.
